# 6. for Python Keyword
## Python
```Python
List = [0,1,2,3,435]
for i in List:
    print(f"{i}-th even number: {i*2}")
```
### Output
```sh
0-th even number: 0
1-th even number: 2
2-th even number: 4
3-th even number: 6
435-th even number: 870
```
## Maths
$$
\begin{matrix}
L = \\{0,1,2,3,435\\};\\
\forall i : (i \in List), \text{«(i-th even number: } i\cdot 2\text{)»}
\end{matrix}
$$

### Calculated Result

$$
\begin{matrix}
\text{0-th even number: 0}\\
\text{1-th even number: 2}\\
\text{2-th even number: 4}\\
\text{3-th even number: 6}\\
\text{435-th even number: 870}\\
\end{matrix}
$$

## Explanation

In mathematics, the symbol "∀" (for all) is used to refer to any value that meets the conditions after ":" (such that).  
  
So ∀i:(i∈List),"(i-th even umber:i⋅2)" means "for any i such that i belongs to the List set, "(i-th even umber:i⋅2)" (set = equivalent to lists, not to be confused with dictionary) will be evaluated.  
  
It's not a universal syntax but I used (...) to evaluate a value within a text
