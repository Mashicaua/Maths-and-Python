# del Python Keyword
## Python
```Python
x = 2
del x
```
## Math
$$x = 2$$
$$\nexists x$$

The symbol $\exists$ in mathematics means "exists", so it is easy to deduce that $\nexists$ means "does not exist".  
  
This is why defining $x$ and then saying that it does not exist is the same as deleting it.
