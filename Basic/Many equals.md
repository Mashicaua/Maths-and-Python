# 1. Variable assignment
## Python
```Python
x = 2
y = 2
x = 3
print(y)
2
```
## Maths
$$ x_0 = 2 $$
$$ y = x_0 $$
$$ x_1 = 3 $$
$$ y $$
Calculated result:
$$ 2 $$

## Explanation
### Python
$x$ is defined as 2.  
Subsequently, $y$ is defined as $x$.  
But $x$ value if changed to 3.  
And since when defining $y$ as $x$ after having defined $x$ as 2, we get 2 when printing $y$, because we referred to the 1st value of $x$ when defining $y$.
### Maths
The initial value of $x$ ($x_0$) is defined as 2.  
The variable $y$ is defined as $x_0$ (2)  
Subsequently, the 2nd value of $x$ ($x_1$) is defined as 3.  
And finally, by writing to $y$, we obtain $x_0$ (2).
