## Python
```Python
x = 2
del x
```
## Math
$$x = 2$$ 
$$\nexists x$$

## Explanation
In mathematics, the symbol $\exists$ indicates that the value that follows it exists.  
  
And it is easy to intuit that, therefore, the crossed out symbol ($\nexists$) means that it does not exist, and that is how $\nexists x$ means that $x$ does not exist.
  
Defining $x$ and then saying that it does not exist is the equivalent of delete $x$ from existence.
